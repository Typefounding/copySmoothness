Copy Smoothness
==========

A simple Robofont extension to copy point smoothness from one font to another font(s) if the glyph from the source is interpolatable with the glyph in the destination. This is useful for getting the same smoothness in points in interpolated instances.

There is an option to mark changed glyphs with a color.
